# freebie

Freebie is a specialized marketplace that helps connect users with each other to find a new home for unwanted or broken items, and also provides other resources to help donate to organizations. By Bryan Chan.

Please be aware that the app only works in android. This app was created WITHOUT the use of firebase, and doesn't rely on expensive apis to run.
